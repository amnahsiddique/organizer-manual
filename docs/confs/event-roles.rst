Other Important Roles to Remember
=================================

* **Proposal reviewers** 
  * In 2016 this group was expanded to include folks who weren't otherwise organizers, 
    and the process was streamlined. It's still time-consuming and intense, 
    because we try to decide pretty quickly after the CFP closes.

* **Emcee** 
  * Historically this person hasn't necessarily been one of the main organizers. Must be someone personable, 
    with good voice and stage presence, but also good at keeping things brief, getting out of the way, and 
    helping troubleshoot speaker issues as needed.
